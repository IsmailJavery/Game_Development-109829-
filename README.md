üìê PROJECT SCOPE
‚Ä¢ Budget: 5000 Rs.
‚Ä¢ Timeline: 4 Months.

ELEVATOR PITCH
We are undergraduate students in BS-CS. We worked on unity- 3D. We experienced
game development by making different games in unity-3D and for our project we
select the game to develop which increase our productivity helps us to polish our
game development skills as we learn many new things developing this game.

üíµMONETIZATION:
Thinking out of box? When the levels increased game becomes more interesting
and user don‚Äôt want to lose the game, we should increase some extra lives and
extra points for user which help player to save his game, player buys this points/life
by this we should generate revenue. Or we should add replay feature by watching
video using this video we collaborate with advertisement companies and increase
their views by making revenue

STORY:
We will make a ZigZag game with different levels user can experience how to face
challenge in fast pace environment, this game made users to love the tricky levels.
If they want to play a game with an objective, they play the levels. It helps player
to enhance his observing skills. You can see that we are bringing for you a very
special 3D ability challenge, in which you will have to be very careful and
concentrated.

GAMEPLAY:
The Zigzag, is a fun and engaging casual game in which you must avoid loss of Car.
This game helps player how to remain focused. The Car and Boundary game. On
the way, there are Boundary. When the game starts the Car start moving if it‚Äôs
